# webscraping
A webscraping app for google that I am working on.
This app has some problems because google has changed something in their code.  It is suppose to open up image files and save them to the home folder.  However it just opens up pages and doesn't save anything. It reads a csv file that I have saved a long with it.  You can edit this to suit your purposes.

## To run
This program uses Python 3.6 to run use in your terminal after you cd into the terminal `python app7.py`
